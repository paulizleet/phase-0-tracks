
1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).

SELECT * FROM teacher;

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

UPDATE teacher SET grade=11 WHERE grade=10;

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

SELECT *
FROM roster
JOIN teacher ON roster.teacher_id = teacher.id;


4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

SELECT teacher.f_name, teacher.l_name, teacher.grade, roster.student_fname, roster.student_lname
FROM roster
JOIN teacher ON roster.teacher_id = teacher.id;

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

DELETE FROM roster WHERE id=1;
