Release 4: Reflect.
	
	I missed my GPS date accidentally, but coincidentally there was also technical trouble with hangouts meaning I wouldn't have made it in the first place.


    What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
		
		Semantic tags are for giving people who read the code some sense of the structure.  They let the reader know what each block of code is supposed to represent.
	
    What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
		
		The browser reads the text from left to right, top to bottom, rendering everything in order.  Elements that are contained within other elements, for example:

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>
					.
					.
					.
		the browser first realizes it needs to create a table, then a row within that table, and the first cell is a header.  After the topmost element is closed off, it will render the following elements on the same level.

    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
		
		It's really handy to be able to create code snippets, because coding is very repetitive.  It's nice to have a short keystroke to automatically fill out things that you use frequently.

    What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

    	The hardest part of this challenge was simply remembering the syntax of html elements.  That should all become second nature with further practice!
